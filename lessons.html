                                <li>Confirmed that existing SHP processes are acceptable for the course, reducing the need to create a new project from scratch</li>

                                <li>A quick introductory call is effective for confirming partnership interest, but a longer in-person meeting is needed for detailed planning</li>

                                <li>Reverse planning from the April 25 build date is essential for identifying critical path activities</li>
                                <li>Project scope should focus on four &ldquo;lines of effort&rdquo;: manpower, materials, location, and logistics</li>
                                <li>Not all SHP builds are public; understanding the difference between closed and open builds is important for volunteer coordination</li>
                                <li>Bedding drive requires targeting 40 twin &ldquo;bed-in-a-bag&rdquo; sets, sourced from retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Kohl&rsquo;s</li>
                                <li>A single point of contact for communication with Paul is critical for clear, efficient coordination</li>

                            <p><strong>Reverse Planning &amp; Lines of Effort:</strong> Paul&rsquo;s emphasis on working backwards from the April 25 build date provided a clear framework for milestone planning. Organizing work into distinct &ldquo;lines of effort&rdquo; (manpower, materials, location, logistics) gives the team a structured way to divide responsibilities and track progress independently across each area.</p>
